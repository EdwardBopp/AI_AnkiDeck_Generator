# AI_AnkiDeck_Generator
This converts an JSON-answer with a specific format from Gemini (or any other AI) to an Anki-Deck. This Anki-Deck then contains flashcards with questions and answers generated from an AI. The answers also contain a png-file of the slide from which the answer/question was taken from. This way there is no need for looking up your slides.
